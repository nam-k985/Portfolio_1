### Task  
The task is to analyse a car sales dataset that contains thousands of records. The dataset comprises fields such as car name, year of purchase, selling price, kilometres driven, fuel type, seller type, transmission type, and ownership history.

### Data Used  
The dataset consists of attributes including car details (name, year, km driven, etc.), selling price, and other factors like fuel type, transmission, and ownership history. This data enables insights into car resale trends.

### Algorithms Applied  
To address missing data, rows where "year" is missing or "fuel" is marked as 'none' are removed. Descriptive statistics and grouping methods in pandas are used to summarize attributes like km driven and selling prices by seller and ownership type. Boxplots are generated to analyze correlations between different factors and selling prices.

### Deployment/Execution  
The analysis is executed in Python using pandas for data manipulation, seaborn and matplotlib for visualizations. The workflow can be run in Jupyter or Google Colab by reading the dataset via pandasâ€™ `read_csv()` function.

### Key Takeaways  
- Missing data significantly reduces dataset size.
- Cars from dealers and those with automatic transmissions tend to have higher selling prices.
- Diesel vehicles command a higher resale value, and newer cars fetch higher prices.
- Boxplots reveal clear correlations between ownership history, seller type, fuel type, and car pricing trends.
